This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: the conflict between mutable and immutable references. The `bug.rs` file shows code that attempts to use both mutable and immutable references to the same variable which causes a compile time error in Rust. The `bugSolution.rs` provides a solution showing how to avoid this error.  Understanding this concept is crucial for writing safe and correct Rust code.
